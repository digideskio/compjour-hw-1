I connected my Twitter bot (@wormsinradish), authenticating the app and connecting the account with Tweepy.

I would create a Twitter bot that would pull weather data about specific areas using the Open Weather Map API (http://openweathermap.org/api) and if you tweeted a message at it with a location, it would tweet back a message depending on the weather at that location, with a corresponding image that generally fits the weather description.

It would be in the following buckets:

If it was 80 degrees and above and not raining
If it was 80 degrees and above and raining
If it was 60-80 degrees and not raining
If it was 60-80 degrees and raining
If it was 32-60 degrees and not raining
If it was 32-60 degrees and raining
If it was 32 degrees and below and not snowing
If it was 32 degrees and below and snowing
